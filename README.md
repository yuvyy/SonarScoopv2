# üîç SonarScoop v2 - AI powered SonarQube Security Hotspots Analyzer and Exporter

LLM-Powered SonarQube Security Hotspot Reviewer is a tool that automates the analysis of security hotspots identified by SonarQube using a large language model (LLM). It extracts the relevant code segments flagged by SonarQube, sends them to an LLM for contextual understanding, and returns a verdict on whether each hotspot is a false positive or a valid security vulnerability.

## Each analysis includes:

- Verdict (False Positive or Valid Vulnerability)

- Detailed Observations

- Recommendation for mitigation or improvement

- Potential Impact
